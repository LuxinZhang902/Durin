# 🏛️ Compliance Groups Feature

## Overview
Added a new **"Compliance Groups"** filter that visualizes countries grouped by similar AML/KYC regulatory frameworks, making it easy to understand which countries share compliance standards.

---

## ✨ What It Does

When you click the **"Compliance Groups"** filter:
1. **Shows only country nodes** (hides user nodes)
2. **Creates connections** between countries with similar compliance frameworks
3. **Color-coded edges** show different regulatory groups
4. **Interactive legend** explains each compliance group

- **Legend** showing what each color means

### **Edge Colors**
- **Blue (FATF Strict):** rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6)
- **Purple (EU Framework):** rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.6)

## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### **Frontend (`GraphVisualization.jsx`)**

**Compliance Groups Definition:**
```javascript
const complianceGroups = {
  'FATF_STRICT': ['United States', 'United Kingdom', 'Singapore'],
  'EU_FRAMEWORK': ['United Kingdom'],
  'NORTH_AMERICA': ['United States', 'Canada']
}
```

**Edge Creation Logic:**
- Filters to show only country nodes
- Creates virtual edges between countries in same group
- Assigns `compliance_group` metadata to each edge
- Edge type: `compliance_similarity`

**Color Coding:**
```javascript
const getLinkColor = (link) => {
  if (link.edge_type === 'compliance_similarity') {
    if (link.compliance_group === 'FATF_STRICT') return 'rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.6)'
    if (link.compliance_group === 'EU_FRAMEWORK') return 'rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.6)'
    if (link.compliance_group === 'NORTH_AMERICA') return 'rgba(34, 197, 94, 0.6)'
  }
}
```

### **Frontend (`App.jsx`)**

**New Filter Button:**
```jsx
<button onClick={() => setGraphFilter('compliance_groups')}>
  <Scale className="w-3.5 h-3.5" />
  <span>Compliance Groups</span>
</button>
```
