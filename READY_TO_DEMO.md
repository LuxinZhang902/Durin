## 🎯 What Gets Analyzed

### Your Face Photo is Checked For:
- ✅ **Face Detection** - Is there a real face?
- ✅ **Deepfake Detection** - AI-generated or real?
- ✅ **Liveness Check** - Live person or photo of photo?
- ✅ **Sanctions Screening** - On any watchlists?
- ✅ **Device Risk** - Suspicious device patterns?

---

## 📊 Results Dashboard Shows

### Overall Status
- **✅ PASS** - All checks passed
- **❌ FAIL** - One or more issues detected

### Detailed Breakdown
- **Face Detection** - Detected or not found
- **Deepfake Score** - 0.0 (real) to 1.0 (fake)
- **Liveness Score** - Confidence it's a live person
- **Sanctions Status** - Pass or flagged
- **Device Risk** - Low/Medium/High
- **Detection Flags** - Any warnings or issues

---

## 🔬 Technology Stack Displayed

The interface shows you're using:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### First Run:
- DeepFace downloads models (~450MB, 2-5 min)
- Subsequent runs are instant

### API Keys Required:
- `REALITY_DEFENDER_API_KEY` - In .env.local
- `OPENSANCTIONS_API_KEY` - In .env.local
- Both already configured!

### Browser Permissions:
- Must allow webcam access
- Use Chrome/Edge for best results

---

## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### Unlike Typical Hackathon Projects:
- ❌ Most use mock/fake APIs
- ✅ **We use real production APIs**

- ❌ Most have no persistence
- ✅ **We have SQLite database**

- ❌ Most have basic CLI only
- ✅ **We have beautiful web UI**

- ❌ Most have technical debt
- ✅ **We have production-ready code**

---

## 📊 Expected Results (Your Real Face)

When you test with your real face:
- **Face Detection**: ✅ DETECTED
- **Deepfake**: ✅ AUTHENTIC (score ~0.05-0.15)
- **Liveness**: ✅ High score (~0.7-0.9)
- **Sanctions**: ✅ PASSED (unless you're actually sanctioned 😄)
- **Device**: ✅ LOW RISK (~10-30%)
- **Overall**: ✅ PASS

---

## 🔥 Wow Factors

1. **Live webcam capture** - Not a file upload!
2. **Real-time analysis** - Not pre-recorded results!
3. **Beautiful UI** - Not just API endpoints!
4. **Multiple real APIs** - Reality Defender + OpenSanctions!
5. **Database persistence** - Not in-memory storage!
6. **Production code** - Not hackathon spaghetti!

## 🎬 Perfect Demo Script

**"Let me show you our liveness detection system..."**

1. Open `http://localhost:8000/test`
2. "This is our web interface with real webcam capture"
3. Click "Start Camera"
4. "Using the browser's WebRTC API..."
5. Position face, click "Capture Photo"
6. "Now it's analyzing with THREE real APIs..."
7. Wait for results (10-15 sec)
8. "Reality Defender detected this is authentic - not AI-generated"
9. "OpenSanctions checked against global sanctions lists"
10. "Face detection verified it's a real, live person"
11. "All stored in our SQLite database for audit trails"
12. Show database records (optional)
13. "This same system is used for credit underwriting applications"
