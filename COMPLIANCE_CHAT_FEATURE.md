## 📊 Example Conversation

**User clicks on Jack (United States)**

```
AI: Hi! I'm your compliance assistant. Ask me anything about 
United States's AML/KYC regulations, fraud risks, or regulatory 
requirements.

User: What are the reporting thresholds for suspicious transactions?

AI: In the United States, financial institutions must file a 
Suspicious Activity Report (SAR) with FinCEN when they detect 
transactions of $5,000 or more that appear suspicious. For 
currency transactions, a Currency Transaction Report (CTR) is 
required for amounts exceeding $10,000. These requirements are 
mandated by the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and enforced by FinCEN.

User: What happens if we don't report?

AI: Failure to file SARs can result in severe penalties including:
- Civil penalties up to $100,000 per violation
- Criminal penalties including imprisonment
- Regulatory sanctions and license revocation
- Reputational damage
FinCEN takes non-compliance very seriously, and repeat offenders 
face escalating consequences.
